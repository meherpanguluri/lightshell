## Why LightShell?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="JS Only" icon="seti:javascript">
    Write your app in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No Rust, no Go, no native code. The Go backend is invisible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Under 5MB" icon="rocket">
    Your finished app ships as a native binary under 5MB. Electron apps are 180MB+. Tauri apps are ~8MB. LightShell wins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Webviews" icon="laptop">
    Uses WKWebView on macOS and WebKitGTK on Linux. No bundled browser. That is how the binary stays tiny.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Friendly" icon="star">
    Designed so AI agents can generate working desktop apps in a single response. Simple APIs, zero config complexity.
  </Card>
